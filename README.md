# The-Curious-Analyst

These are some projects I have implemented using R and Python. As I am starting my journey in the Analytics domain I wish to share my 
code and thought process to get feedback and improvement suggestions. 

If any suggestions/feedback you can contact me on Linkedln.

 1. K-Means: I Applied the K-Means algorithm in python without using any analytics pakages. This is helpful to understand the logic and 
            build up the basics.
            
2. Graph Conversion: The purpose of this exercise is to test the ability to use basic Python data structures such as lists, dictionaries,                         and numpy's array. The graphs will all be directed, which is to say that two edges are needed to get to and from two                      different nodes.
